title: Call for "Community Feedback Experts"
---

## Background

**Planning for Open Grants: Fostering a Transparent and Accessible National Research Infrastructure**, an initiative led by the University of Florida, has undertaken an 18-month effort to establish a blueprint for implementation of a repository of openly accessible grant proposals and funding guidelines. One major goal of the project is to examine and better understand the needs of particular academic and professional communities by incorporating perspectives from "community feedback experts" from across these fields. These experts will work alongside the project's advisory committee to foster conversation and develop case studies to guide future work.

Community feedback experts will inform and shape the Planning for Open Grants project by delving into specific opportunities, concerns, and challenges within three targeted communities: 

* libraries and archives, especially in academic spaces
* STEM postdoctoral and early career researchers
* Caribbean studies, especially in humanities and social sciences

By "experts," we mean individuals who engage professionally and/or have an advanced degree in a related field. Experts should have some experience applying for and/or reviewing grants and a keen interest in finding ethical, feasible ways to share proposals. Experts may be at any point in their career.

Each expert is expected to:

* Give a 15-30 min. virtual presentation on a project, publication, etc. related to sharing grant proposals or grant-related data.
* Co-facilitate a virtual community call where individuals engaged with each domain will discuss current work and next steps. This will include one planning call and a request to recommend potential participants.
* In collaboration with community members and the PFOG team, co-author and edit a short case study describing existing infrastructure for proposal sharing in each domain.

_Experts will receive a $1,000 stipend for their service to the project. Funding is available to support up to 15 experts. It is expected that all work will take place remotely._

## To apply, please submit, by **Friday, May 5**:

* A short (1-2 paragraphs) expression of interest
* A short (no more than 1-2 pages) resume or CV

via email to [ogrants@googlegroups.com](mailto:ogrants@googlegroups.com?subject={YOUR NAME} Application for Community Feedback Expert, Planning for Open Grants), with the subject "{YOUR NAME} Application for Community Feedback Expert, Planning for Open Grants"

## Authorship Policy
As the organizers of the Planning for Open Grants project, our goal is to foster discussions and progress towards recognizing and sharing grant proposals. In alignment with this goal, we strive to share our work openly in ways that acknowledge the efforts and contributions of everyone involved and enable them to receive credit and recognition. In practice, we hope to publish and share materials such as the presentation and case study through platforms such as the Open Science Framework so that the works can be cited and authors acknowledged.

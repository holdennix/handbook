## The call

We would like to invite interested researchers and stakeholders to share their grant proposals of any area of knowledge written in English and/or in Portuguese. 

This project is part of PhD studies in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) at University of São Paulo – one of the world's top 100 universities. 

## Aim

The aim is to investigate the writing of grant proposals as an attempt to understand the linguistic and rhetorical features, across disciplines, of proposals written in both English and Portuguese. Ultimately, the study’s goal is to determine/comprehend what factors may impact the success or failure in obtaining research funding.

Considering that grant proposals are not publicly available, they represent a type of text that is not well-known and requires scientific investigation. This study may benefit particularly the new generation of researchers from  various fields, particularly, those in low-income or middle-income countries (LMICs).

## How to submit

Please submit your grant proposals at [https://redcap.link/grantproposals](https://redcap.link/grantproposals) .

## Important

No identification is required and those contributing are encouraged to anonymize their grant proposals.

Submit your grant proposal and contribute to advance of studies of this genre written in international contexts. 

## Questions and concerns may be addressed to

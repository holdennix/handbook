## The call

We would like to invite interested researchers and stakeholders to share their grant proposals of any area of knowledge written in English and/or in Portuguese. 

This project is part of PhD studies in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) at University of São Paulo – one of the world's top 100 universities. 

## Aim

The purpose is to investigate the writing of grant proposals across disciplines as an
attempt to understand the linguistic and rhetorical features of proposals written in both
English and Portuguese. Ultimately, the study’s goal is to determine/comprehend what
factors may impact the success or failure in obtaining research funding.

Considering that grant proposals are not publicly available, they represent a type of text
that is not well-known and requires scientific investigation. This study may benefit the
new generation of researchers from various fields, particularly, those in low-income or
middle-income countries (LMICs).

## Incentive

Those contributing with the research will be invited for a hybrid course on Grant
Proposals Writing in English and Portuguese promoted by PhD student responsible for the
research.

A certificate will be issued by the Laboratory of Academic Literacy of the Department of
Modern Languages of Faculty of Philosophy, Languages and Literature, and Human
Sciences of the University of São Paulo – USP.

## How to submit

Please submit your grant proposals at [https://redcap.link/grantproposals](https://redcap.link/grantproposals) .

## Important

No identification is required and those contributing are encouraged to anonymize their grant proposals.

Submit your grant proposal and contribute to advance of studies of this genre written in international contexts. 

## Questions and concerns may be addressed to
